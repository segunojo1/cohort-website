## WELCOME TO COHORT - SOCIAL LAYER FOR STUDENTS
- Cohort is a platform that helps students make friends, find roommates, and feel connected through shared interests and events.
- No platform is designed specifically for friendships in University.
- Our AI (Lena) introduces friends and roommates based on interests, vibe, and intent.
- Don’t show up alone: Cohort pairs students attending the same events.
- Need a specific person? Ask Lena  — “Find me a Swift developer,” “a baking friend,” or “a cofounder”.
